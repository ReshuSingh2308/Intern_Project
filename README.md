# Intern_Project

👋 About Me
Hi, I'm a Data Analyst Intern passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights. I specialize in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization using Python, Power BI, and machine learning tools.

Currently, I'm working on projects involving retail sales analysis, including a deep dive into Zudio's national sales data. From identifying top-performing cities and product categories to building a Python-based pricing engine, I aim to make data-driven decisions accessible and impactful.

🔧 Tools & Skills
Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)

BI & Visualization: Power BI, Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Model Evaluation, Feature Engineering

Other Skills: Data cleaning, trend forecasting, strategic recommendations, pricing automation

🛠 Featured Projects
🏬 Zudio Sales Analysis: End-to-end analysis of 7,899+ sales records; identified seasonal trends, city-wise performance, and inventory optimization strategies.

💡 Strategic Suggestions Report: Developed pricing and inventory tactics for slow-moving stock using ABC analysis and demand forecasting.

🤖 Airbnb Pricing Engine: Built a linear regression model and deployed it as a script-based pricing engine to predict nightly rates based on listing features.

I'm always eager to collaborate on real-world projects where data can drive smarter decisions.
